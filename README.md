# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION USING DECISION TREE

This project is completed as part of the CodSoft Machine Learning Virtual Internship (August 2025).
It aims to classify Iris flowers into three species using a supervised machine learning algorithm (Decision Tree Classifier).

# INTERN DETAILS:
 Name:Bhargavi Reddy  
 Internship Title:Machine Learning Virtual Internship  
 Project:Iris Flower Classification  
 Batch:August 2025  
 Platform:Google Colab / Python / scikit-learn
 
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Build a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flower species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on flower measurements:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width

# Dataset Information
Dataset: Built-in `Iris` dataset from `scikit-learn`
Total Samples: 150
Features:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)
Target: Flower species (3 classes)

# Technologies & Tools Used
Language: Python  
IDE: Google Colab  
# Libraries:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn

# Steps Performed

1. Imported necessary libraries
2. Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
3. Visualized feature relationships using Seaborn Pairplot
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (70:30)
5. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
6. Made predictions on the test data
7. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report
8. Predicted output for a custom flower sample
9. Visualized the decision tree structure

# Model Used
Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier  
Why?
  - Easy to interpret and visualize  
  - Works well with small datasets  
  - No need for feature scaling  

# Results
Model Accuracy: ~97%  
Classification Report: High precision and recall for all classes  
# Prediction Example: 
  Input â†’ `[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]`  
  Output â†’ `'setosa'`

# Visualizations

Seaborn Pairplot to understand feature separability
Decision Tree Graph to visualize how the model makes decisions

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how simple and interpretable machine learning models like Decision Trees can effectively classify species with high accuracy, 
especially on well-structured datasets like Iris. It was a great hands-on opportunity to understand:
- Data preparation
- Visualization
- Model training & evaluation
